- Player Jumps and moves towards the left infinitely without stopping

- Platforms Spawn indefinitely but the gap between the new platforms has an issue currently.

- Player is restricted from jumping in the air and can only jump once they touch the ground.

- Platforms that the player has passed are removed from the game.

- Spacing is randomized between the platforms but an error causes platforms to spawn within each other

- The platforms are placed within an array that activates and deactivates platforms in front of the player.

- Spawn height for the platforms is also randomized.

- jumping has been improved and the height of the jump can be affected by the player
